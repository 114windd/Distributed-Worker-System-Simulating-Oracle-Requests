ðŸ“„ PRD: Distributed Worker System â€“ Simulating Oracle Requests

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a distributed worker system in Go that simulates oracle requests. A central Coordinator will accept incoming requests, dispatch them to multiple Workers, and then collect and aggregate the results into a final answer. This will mimic the behavior of blockchain oracle networks, where data is retrieved from multiple external sources before reaching consensus.

The system should simulate oracle-like behavior such as:

- Randomized response times (to mimic network latency).

- Occasional worker failures (to simulate unreliable nodes).

- Slightly varied responses (to simulate data discrepancies across sources).

The Coordinator will use Goâ€™s context.Context package for timeouts and partial response handling, ensuring robust behavior even if workers are delayed or fail.

Level:

Intermediate

Type of Project:

- Distributed Systems

- Go (Concurrency, Context)

- Simulation of Blockchain Oracle Behavior

Skills Required:

- Go (goroutines, context)

- Worker pool and queue design

- Error handling and resilience patterns

- API development (REST) - Gin 

Key Features:

Milestone 1: Core Worker Pool & Coordinator

- Coordinator service to accept oracle requests.

- Worker pool implementation with goroutines.

- HTTP REST communication between Coordinator and Workers.

- Result aggregation with average as default strategy.

- Timeouts via context.WithTimeout.

Milestone 2: Oracle Simulation Enhancements

- Randomized worker response times.

- Simulated worker failures (random error injection).

- Simulated variance in returned values.

- Worker metadata collection:

- Response time per worker.

- Reliability score (success vs failure rate).

Milestone 3: Fault Tolerance & Scaling

- Graceful handling when most workers fail (return partial aggregation with warning).

- Multiple concurrent oracle requests supported.

- Scale worker pool dynamically.

- Logging and reporting worker performance.

System Design

Key Components:

Coordinator

- Receives oracle requests.

- Dispatches tasks to worker pool (via channels).

- Collects and aggregates responses.

- Tracks metadata (worker performance, response times).

Workers

- Independent goroutines.

- Process tasks with randomized latency and possible failure.

- Return results with metadata.

Aggregator

- Default: average across valid worker responses.

Client Simulation

- Submits oracle requests to Coordinator.

- Displays final result with worker breakdown.

Fault Tolerance Strategy:

- If some workers fail: aggregate results from successful workers only.

- If most workers fail: return partial result with metadata flagging low reliability.

- Coordinator will record reliability scores to track worker trustworthiness over time.
